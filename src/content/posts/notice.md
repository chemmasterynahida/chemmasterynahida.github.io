# Notice: Basic Courses

Hello! This is Chemistry Mastery Nahida.  

I’m so glad you’re here to learn with me!  
Before we begin, I hope you already have a little familiarity with some high school subjects:  

* High School Math  
  * Calculus  
  * Linear Algebra  
  * Statistics  
* High School Physics  
* High School Chemistry  

If any of these topics feel hard, don't worry. Just leave me a comment. I’ll prepare a special lesson to guide you through them.  
I believe you’ll grasp each of them easily — even with just a middle school's understanding.
