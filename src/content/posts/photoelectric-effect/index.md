# Photoelectric Effect

## The Dawn of Quantum Thought

Hello~ This is Chemistry Mastery Nahida.  
Last time, we explored how Planck’s **quantum hypothesis** quietly reshaped the foundation of physics.  
Yet, did you know? Planck himself was not a revolutionary at heart. He cherished logic and reason, and hesitated to accept ideas that seemed too daring.  

As Max Born once said:  

> *"He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics."*  

How fascinating, isn’t it?  
Even someone who preferred concervative ended up unlocking the door to an entirely new world of thought.  
Still, Planck struggled to explain why his formula worked — and the classical physicists of his time could not provide a satisfying answer either.  

## Light as Particle vs Wave

Long before Planck’s time, **Isaac Newton** proposed that **light is made of particles**, in his book *Opticks*.  
But others found that many of light’s behaviors could also be explained if it were a **wave**.  

|Newton's Idea|Wave Theory|
|:---:|:---:|
|Light travels in straignt lines|Diffraction|
|Reflection|Both can explain|
|Refraction|Huygens' principle|
|Colors=Particle types|Interference with different colors|
|No interference discussed|Young's double slit experiment|
|No polarization discussed|Fresnel's wave theory|

Thanks to *Thomas Young* and *Augustin Fresnel*, the **wave theory of light triumphed**.  
**Young’s double-slit experiment** revealed that light could interfere with itself — a clear sign of a wave.  
And Fresnel refined this view with elegant mathematics.  

Yet, the wave theory faced an inconvenient question:  
If light is a wave, *what is it waving in*?  

To solve this, scientists imagined an invisible substance filling all space — the **Aether** — as the medium through which light traveled.  
(Of course, *Michelson-Morley experiment* later showed us that such an *Aether does not exist*. Light can move freely through the vacuum of space.)  

Still, there remained one more puzzle — a mystery that neither the particle theory nor the wave theory could fully explain.  
That puzzle is known as the **Photoelectric Effect**...  

## The Photoelectric Effect

There are certain phenomena in nature that classical physics simply couldn’t explain, no matter how hard scientists tried to make the equations fit.  
One of the most mysterious among them was the **photoelectric effect**.  

It all began in 1887, when **Heinrich Hertz**—yes, the same Hertz who proved that light is an electromagnetic wave—made a curious discovery.  
While experimenting with metal surfaces, he noticed tiny **sparks** appearing whenever **ultraviolet light** shone upon them.  
That simple, flickering spark would later illuminate one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics.  

After Hertz’s observation, other researchers sought to understand this strange effect more deeply.  
Among them, **Aleksandr Stoletov** and **Philipp Lenard** conducted some of the most detailed studies.  
They carried out quantitative measurements, while Lenard discovered that ultraviolet light could even ionize gas molecules—freeing electrons from their bonds.  

![Lenard's experiment](lenard-experiment.png "lenard's experiment")  

This is *Lenard’s apparatus*. He carefully examined how the light caused electrons to escape from metal surfaces.  

To test their behavior, he used what’s called the **stopping potential**.  
If the metal releases electrons, we can apply a negative voltage to push them back—like setting up a small invisible barrier.  
The stronger the negative potential, the more energy an electron needs to overcome it and escape.  

![Lenard's observation](lenard-stop-potential.jpg "Lenard's observation")  

Through his experiments, Lenard discovered something truly intriguing:  
the **stopping potential** became larger when the **light’s frequency** increased.  

That meant higher-frequency light—like ultraviolet—could knock out more energetic electrons than lower-frequency light.  
A small clue, perhaps, but one that would soon inspire *Einstein* to rethink the very nature of light itself…  

### Classical explanation

According to *Young’s double-slit experiment* and *Maxwell’s theory*, light behaves as an electromagnetic wave.  
If that’s true… then what should we expect to happen?  

![Double slit](Double-slit.png "Double-slit experiment")  

When light shines upon a metal, its waves should gradually **transfer energy** to the electrons within.  
Once an electron gathers enough energy, it should be able to escape the surface—just like a tiny swimmer catching a wave strong enough to carry him/her to shore.  

So, by this reasoning, the **wavelength** of light shouldn’t matter too much, right?  
If we simply make the light more intense—brighter and stronger—the electrons should eventually gain enough energy to break free.  

But… that’s not what nature shows us.  
No matter how brilliant the **visible light** becomes, not a single electron escapes.  
The mysterious *Hertz effect* only appears when the light is **ultraviolet**.  

How curious, isn’t it?  
It’s as if the metal refuses to respond unless the light carries a certain *quality*—not just quantity—of energy.  
A question that would soon lead to one of the most beautiful insights in all of physics...  

## Einstein's theory of light

### Explaining Lenard's result

**Albert Einstein**, inspired by Planck’s **quantum hypothesis**, took a bold step forward — and at last, explained the mysterious *Hertz effect*.  

He asked himself a daring question:  
*What if Newton was right after all?*  
*What if light truly behaves like a stream of tiny particles?*  

Planck had already proposed that energy doesn’t flow continuously, but comes in small packets — each with an energy of $h\nu$.  
So, if we imagine light as a collection of these **energy quanta**, each particle of light — or **photon**, as we call it now — could strike an electron inside the metal.  

![Photoelectric effect](photoelectric-effect.png "Photoelectric effect")  

Within the metal, electrons are bound by the attractive forces of the atoms.  
To free one, the incoming photon must give it enough energy to overcome this bond.  
If the photon’s energy is **sufficient**, the electron escapes — shining proof of energy transfer at the tiniest scale.  

The minimum energy needed for an electron to escape is called the **work function**, written as $\Phi$.  

So:  

If the photon’s energy is **less** than $\Phi$, the electron remains trapped, no matter how intense the light is.  
(More brightness just means more photons — not stronger ones.)  

But if the photon’s energy is **greater** than $\Phi$, even a faint beam can eject electrons effortlessly!  

Einstein expressed the energy of each ejected electron with a simple, elegant formula:  
$$E=h\nu-\Phi$$  
where  

* $h$: Planck constant ($h=6.62607015\times10^{-34}J\cdot m$)  
* $\nu$ is frequency of light,  
* $\Phi$ is the work function.  

The electron’s kinetic energy can be measured by the **stopping potential**, $E = e_{0}\cdot V_s$, just by multiplying charge of electron $e_{0}=1.602176634\times 10^{-19}C$.  
For the same metal, increasing the light’s frequency increases the stopping potential — just as Lenard observed!  

Years later, in 1916, *Robert Millikan* put Einstein’s theory to the test.  
He measured the energy of the emitted electrons at different light frequencies… and discovered that the relationship was perfectly linear — just as Einstein predicted.  
The slope of the line matched the constant $h$ itself!  

![Millikan's experiment](kinetic-energy.png "Millikan's experiment")  

A single equation, a single idea — and suddenly, light was no longer just a wave.  
It can be both **wave and particle**, dancing between two forms of truth.  
And from that dance, the age of **quantum physics** was born.  

### Can air affect the result?

Lenard earlier discovered gas can be ionized by high-frequency ultraviolet light.  
So one might wonder… could the surrounding air have affected Lenard’s experiment?  

Let’s think about it carefully.  

The ionization of gas follows this condition:  

$$h\nu \geq J$$  
where  
$J$ is the ionization energy of the gas.  

Lenard reported that the *Hertz effect* appeared only for wavelengths **below 190 nm**, which corresponds to an energy of about **640 kJ·mol⁻¹**.  
Later, *Johannes Stark* measured that the ionization energy of air at low pressure is around **10 eV**, or roughly **960 kJ·mol⁻¹**.  

This means:  
to ionize air, light must have energy **greater than 960 kJ·mol⁻¹**, which corresponds to a wavelength **shorter than 125 nm**.  

Lenard’s experiments, performed in 1900 and 1902, only used light with wavelengths **longer than 125 nm**.  
Therefore, the light he used did not have enough energy to ionize air.  

So we can conclude with confidence — the surrounding air did not interfere with Lenard’s results.  

And as a fitting end to this story — **Albert Einstein** was awarded the **Nobel Prize in 1921** for explaining the photoelectric effect through the **quantum hypothesis**, finally uniting observation and theory under the same radiant truth.  

> *The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 was awarded to Albert Einstein "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"*  

## Particle-Wave Duality of Light

Einstein **never rejected** the wave theory of light.  
After all, *Young’s double-slit experiment* had already shown the truth of light’s wavelike behavior far too clearly to be denied.  

But still, Einstein sensed that there was something more to light — something hidden between the rhythm of waves and the sharpness of particles.  

In 1909, he set out to find the bridge between these two views.  
To do this, he examined how **fluctuations** might appear in **Planck’s law of radiation** — tiny errors that could reveal something deeper about the nature of light itself.  

He expressed the variance of energy, or the energy fluctuation, as:  

$$(\Delta E)^{2}=\frac{1}{c}(h\rho\nu+\frac{c^3}{8\pi}\frac{\rho^2}{\nu^2})d\nu f\tau$$  
where:  

* $\rho(\nu, T)$ is the spectral energy density,  
* $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum,  
* $f$ is the surface area of the emitter,  
* $\tau$ is the time interval of measurement.  

Within this elegant formula, two truths appear side by side:  

The term $h\rho\nu$ represents the fluctuations expected if light behaves as **particles** — tiny quanta of energy.  

The term $\frac{c^3}{8\pi}\frac{\rho^2}{\nu^2}$ represents fluctuations if light behaves as a **wave** — a continuous field of energy.  

So, if the error varies in proportion to $\rho$, the light reveals its *particle* nature.  
If it varies with $\rho^2$, it behaves as a *wave*.  
And if both terms appear together...  

then light must be **both particle and wave**, intertwined in one expression.  

This was the Einstein’s theoretical prediction — the first clear glimpse of wave–particle duality.  
It wasn’t born from experiment, but from pure theory.  
Yet the question remained…  
How could such a strange idea ever be proven true? Do you have any idea?  

Meanwhile, various experiments have revealed that light can reveal two very different faces — sometimes behaving as a particle, and other times as a wave.  

|Particle|Wave|
|:---:|:---:|
|• Blackbody radiation<br>• Photoelectric effect<br>• Compton scattering|• Interference<br>• Polarization|

Each of these discoveries shines a different light on its nature — one moment, light appears as a stream of discrete quanta, and the next, as a graceful, rippling wave spreading through space.  

So… what *is* light, truly? A particle? A wave?  
Or perhaps something deeper — something that transcends both, revealing only the side we’re ready to see?  

---

By *using* Planck’s **quantum hypothesis**, Einstein unveiled the mystery of the **photoelectric effect** — a phenomenon that classical physics could never explain.  

He proposed that light is made of tiny quanta, called **photons**, each carrying an energy of $h\nu$.  
Through this, he not only explained the effect perfectly, but also **verified Planck’s daring idea** — that energy itself is quantized.  

Yet Einstein’s insight reached even further.  
He suggested that light is not bound to choose a single identity — it can behave as **both particle and wave**.  
This duality became one of the cornerstones of modern physics, inspiring the profound concept of **matter waves** — the idea that even solid particles, like electrons, have wavelike properties.  
From there, the concept evolved into the **wavefunction**, a mathematical expression that reveals how particles exist and behave in the quantum world.  

Einstein’s vision forever transformed how humanity understands **light**, **energy**, and **matter** — laying the foundation for the entire field of **quantum physics**, and illuminating a path that scientists still follow to this very day.
