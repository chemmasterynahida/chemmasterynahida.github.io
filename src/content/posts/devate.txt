## How uncertainty principle is finally recognised?

The uncertainty principle was a **challenge** to our common sense.  
Classical mechanics has expected to have **accurate** physical properties.  
Some scientists feel **doubtful**, so they tried to **attack** the principle.  

At the Solvay Conference, there is the famous argument between **Einstein** and **Bohr**.  
The uncertainty principle was also discussed.  

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, Einstein has suggested methods giving exact position and momentum.  
He thinks double-slit experiment, which shows interference of the wave.
